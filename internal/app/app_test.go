   2. View: Test the output of the View method to ensure that it is correct for different input data.

   3. Update: Test the Update method to ensure that it updates the model correctly in response to different messages.

   4. Interactions with the VagrantClient: Test the interactions with the VagrantClient, such as the RunCommand function, to ensure that they are working correctly and returning the expected results.

   5. User input handling: Test the handling of user input, such as keyboard and mouse events, to ensure that they are correctly processed and result in the expected changes to the model.
